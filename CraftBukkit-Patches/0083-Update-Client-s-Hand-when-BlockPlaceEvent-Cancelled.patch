Subject: [PATCH] Update Client's Hand when BlockPlaceEvent Cancelled

Send a Packet103SetSlot to client when a BlockPlaceEvent is cancelled.

Fixes BUKKIT-5284

Currently, whenever a player places a block in a protected area the
equipped itemstack size on client is never updated properly since the
client thinks the block was placed. The reason this happens is because
ItemStack.matches returns true since the server does not decrement stack
size if a BlockPlaceEvent is cancelled. This causes
PlayerConnection.a(handlePlace) not to send the appropriate packet to
client which causes the bug.
